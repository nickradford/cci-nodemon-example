# Nodemon Example

Nodemon is a tool that helps develop Node.js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected.

## Getting Started

1. Install the dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

2. Run the application
```bash
npm start
```

3. Make changes to `server.js` and see the changes reflected in the terminal output.


## Usage in other projects

To use Nodemon in other projects, follow these steps:

1. Install Nodemon globally using npm:
```bash
npm install -g nodemon
```

or install it locally in the project:
```bash
npm install nodemon --save-dev
```

2. Start your Node.js application using Nodemon:
```bash
nodemon your-app.js
```
